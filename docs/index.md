# Max's Memex

**What even is the internet? If you don't know, then you're at the right place, because neither do I! But let's try to learn about it little bits by bits...**

*Hopefully I don't break your mind, but here is how the memex is mapped:*

## Feedback from Memex 1

- Greater emphasis on linking readings to the course and contradictions
- Identified recurring themes and ideas from readings
- Started to link outward to other people's memexes

## Feedback from Memex 2

- Continued to relate source notes to class material and ideas
- Considered how sources relate to each other 
- Reconsidered the map of content, narrowing down into a more concise and specific to the themes of my memex

## To do 

- Well, this is where the memex stops! (at least for now)
- Reconsider the notes into a final journey entry
- Continue looking at the internet (all the oddities that comes with it) with a critical eye
