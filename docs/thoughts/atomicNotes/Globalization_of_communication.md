- According to [National Geographic definition](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/globalization/), **globalization** is "a term used to describe the increasing connectedness and interdependence of world cultures and economies." Therefore, the telegraph can be seen as a tool of globalization as it connects the world through cables. It is important to understand how globalization has been pushed by the inertia of industrialization and colonization, therefore carrying with it imperial characteristics. With the expansion of the telegraph and social necessities, which are rooted in [[Imperial_needs]], communication has been globalized.
