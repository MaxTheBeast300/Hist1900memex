-   What exactly are video games? MacDougall in his [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_otw7hWq58A&ab_channel=WesternUniversity) about video games and cold war seems to think it is a real-time human machine feedback loop. I partly agree with this definition. The human user is definitely interacting with the video games which is hosted on a machine, but it is important to consider the [[Agency]] and intention of that machine. "We shape toys and toys shapes us" (MacDougall, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_otw7hWq58A&ab_channel=WesternUniversity)). When shaping a video game, the intention of the creator is reflected onto the user, but that choice, once made, become invisible and strongly influences the perspective of the user. 
- Especially today, video games can also be seen as digital hubs for communities and social gathering. It creates a new network within the larger network of the internet, flourishing a new culture. The game genre "MMORPG" (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) is probably the best example to show how a new digital ecosystem ([[Media_as_an_ecosystem]]) is created. In these games, a large number of people gathers under a common interest in an interactive way. I could go on for pages about video games, but the idea is that these games influences the players based on the intention of the game developer. What is being controlled ([[Control]])? What is expected of the player? How does the player engage with the machine?
