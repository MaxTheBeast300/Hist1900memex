- When thinking about computers and the digital world, media has normalized us to only see and hear the word: "Men!" and never "women." Why is that? Or maybe we can ask ourself, how is that? Because it is the transmitter of information that has decided that women should be erased from these celebrated spotlights. Only recently has the discourse of women's contribution, in innovations such as computers and male dominated fields, surfaced and started to spread and gain awareness. It's through reading these historical biographies of these women's innovations that we can better understand that the world isn't shaped by men, but by both then covered by men. Once again, the theme of control appears when we discuss information, especially the erasure of important knowledge.
