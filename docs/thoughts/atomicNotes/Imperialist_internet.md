- The internet is an imperialist invention. It controls, dictates, and decides what goes and what doesn't. Its imperialist nature goes back to the creation of the telegraph and the transatlantic telegraph. It was made possible by imperial authority to get what it needs, see [[imperial_needs]] for further elaboration. The connections enabled by the telegraph allowed Europe and North America to further extend their power and influence in the world. It was used to show the world that they were "superior." Therefore, because this connection has been curated for Western audiences, when it eventually transitioned to the internet we know today, it still held imperial power over other countries. In today's internet, Google is a relevant example of imperialism. It retrieves and control data without consent of the individual and uses it against them for political and economic reasons like personalized advertisements. There is also the political exploitation of Western companies towards underdeveloped countries for illegal and immoral activities. The main theme of imperial **control**, which has been recurring throughout the course, is still highly relevant in the 21st century internet. With the current direction of digital politics, it seems digital control will be even more accentuated.
