What happens when you have this abundance of technological competences, but no social neccessities to drive it further? In [Standage's chapter](@standageVictorianInternet1999) about the transatlantic telegraph, the social neccessity of connecting Europe and North America is what propelled the use of competences like steamboats and telegraph cables. It seems like humans are always striving for more and a better technological future, which is even more accentuated by war and the space race, but I wonder if there will come a point where we might have a technological stagnation.
