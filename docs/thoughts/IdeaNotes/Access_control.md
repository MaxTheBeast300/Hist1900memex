- What does it mean to implement access control security protocols for trusted computer in government organizations? Is it an attempt to [[Control]] and protect information? Perhaps, in controlling who can access "official" information, there is [[Agency]] at play. It prevents "unauthorized" people from accessing and limits the amount of people that can go "in." It seems like the introduction of this security protocol fits into the research interest I identified in my memex 2: [[Control_and_censorship]].
