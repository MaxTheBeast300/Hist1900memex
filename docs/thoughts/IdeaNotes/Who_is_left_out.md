- Who is left out as we discuss the history of the internet and how would it possible to found out those people, even after they've passed away? Learning history afterall is trying to piece together the pieces and trying to make sense of the past, but if those pieces are long gone, then maybe the contribution of uncreditted innovators (especially women) are gone to ash.
