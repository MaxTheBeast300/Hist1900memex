- According to [Solarwinds](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/network-node#:~:text=A%20network%20node%20can%20be,one%20endpoint%20to%20the%20other.), a Network Node "can be defined as the connection point among network devices such as routers, printers, or switches that can receive and send data from one endpoint to the other." These nodes are what connects us to the larger topology of networks called the internet, but are we really in control of our own nodes? For example, what prevents an organization from accessing the nodes connecting our cellphones to extract data without us knowing? Do we need to reject privacy in order to gain access to the internet? What is the implication of always being connected?
