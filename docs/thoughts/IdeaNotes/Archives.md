- As we were discussing the methods of classification and cataloguing in libraries, I realized that were only talking about academic and public libraries. Thus, what about the archives library? How does one classify primary sources? I don't think using the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme would prove effective here since we are not dealing with academic papers or knowledge research, but anecdotes, artifacts, pictures, videos, and personal items. Would it even be "right" to classify intimate documents like these, especially if the owner is deceased? It is even more relevant now as archival documents make their way onto the web for public eyes. 

# To_do

- If we take the [Carleton "archives and Special Collection,"](https://library.carleton.ca/asc) we can see that there are no clear classification of the documents except grouping collections together as their own catalogues. Could this classification method be improved? Maybe it is based on a classification scheme that I am not yet aware of, I should do more research.
