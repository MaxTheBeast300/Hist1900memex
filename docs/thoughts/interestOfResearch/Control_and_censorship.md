- It was during the building of my second memex, that I realized that I wanted to learn more about the **political** side of the internet. The internet has been with me since I was born, and will be with me, in increasingly extreme ways, until I die. By better understanding the [[Politics_of_power]] that shaped the development of the telegraph and the [[Globalization_of_communication]], I gained a new perspective on what exactly the internet is. It is a controlled network of communication, based on western classification methods, that contains immense political potential for control and censorship. 
- Eric Desrosiers's [Memex](https://glng3r.github.io/memex/) talks a bit more about [British's motivations for telegraphy](https://glng3r.github.io/memex/website/Headrick%20and%20Griset/Britians%20Motivation%20for%20Telegraphy/) which I found pertinent here because of its political agency. They claim here that colonialism was one of the main motivations, for which I agree. With colonialism, British could increase its economic and political standing, and the telegraph allowed them to keep their power hold on their colonies. 
- The notion of **[[Censorship]]** is especially interesting to me, and I hope to further explore its implications in my third memex.
