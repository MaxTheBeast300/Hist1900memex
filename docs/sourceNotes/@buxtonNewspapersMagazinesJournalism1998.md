### Summary & Key Take Aways

Buxton and McKercher enrolls in a critical exploration of the print media in Canada, especially its evolution in the twentieth century and how its analystical treatment has shifted. The article attemps to provide a critical historiography of the print media in Canada and does so by referencing what has been written about the media since the beginning of the printing presses in Canada. The authors identifies a shift in the reputation of journalism in Canada, with referencing Paul Rutherford who wrote 16 years ago, that the journalist was now thought to be an "unregenrate story-teller who feels a need to excite his audience with a lot of colorful anecdotes and easy generalization" (Buxton et al. 1998, 103). It overall addresses how and why the modern newspaper in Canada took shape. In order to supplant other forms of newspaper financing, newspaper began to advertise and provide broader knowledge, expanding their network. Therefore, the transmission of knowledge through newspaper had now adopted a larger interrelated communication networks between journalists and readers.
