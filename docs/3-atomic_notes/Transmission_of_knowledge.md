-   For those born in the last 2 decades, the immediate access of the internet's vast resources has been something as natural as walking. However, by taking taking this transmission of knowledge for granted, we fail at seeing what came before the web, and how a coordination of agencies made it possible. In the past, authoritative figures like the Alexandria Library and the Church decided who could read what. This selectiveness of knowledge is still present today despite digital libraries being available to all with electricity and an internet connection. What did not change from the past is the presence of **agency** of what kind of knowledge is transmitted. Now that everyone can access the web, it is no longer a matter of controlling **who** *reads*, but **what** *they can and should read.*
