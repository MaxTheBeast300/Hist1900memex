Media cannot be analyzed in a vacuum as it is a result of numerous forces working symbiotically. Media is only its shell, the box that contains the ecosystem. Media is:

>A socially realized structures of communication, where structures include both technological forms and their associated protocols, and where communication is a cultural practice, a ritualized collocation of different people on the same mental map, sharing or engaged with popular ontologies of representation (Gitelman 2006, 7). 

In this way, people influence media and media influence people; when people create new communication practices, the media changes and adapts, but at the same time, when the media changes, the way people communicate and exchange information evolves. Therefore, media is a "box" that fosters a cultural ecosystem that in turn, interacts with its "box" in a perpetual cycle of adaptability and representations.
