It was then concluded that \"the strongest communication system would be a distributed network of computers\" (Denning, 1991, 530). The first step was to break down messages into packets for a packet-switched network; this network started operating in 1970 (Denning, 1991, 530). In the following years, the ARPANET had an exponential growth and the traffic had developed to be primarily electronic mails and therefore, the network needed to accomodate this by reworking the \"end-to-end\" protocol and introducing transport control protocol and internet protocol (Denning, 1991, 530). The explosion of the ARPANET then caused other \"community networks\" to appear such as BITNET with IBMs or CSNET (Denning, 1991, 530). Denning states that although the ARPANET was disbanded in 1990, its legacy changed the way human communicated (Denning, 1991, 532). In his analysis about the network, he concludes with potential concerns around the network such as \"network vulnerabilities\" and conflicts of trust (Denning, 534). As the network expanded, developers needed to consider the threat of intruders, worms, and viruses, which means that a \"network immune system\" was needed (Denning, 1991, 534). Finally, Denning argues about the conflict of trust and how the government's fear for employees abusing their privileges caused them to introduced complicated access controls and increased monitoring.

As the internet was meant to be free, there was a democratization of publishing, which means that anyone could publish ideas on the web. This sparked the early days of social media, giving the ability for people to catch up with friends not seen in years without actually interacting with them (through calls or meeting). They could just read their friends' page on twitter or facebook and always know what they were up to. This democratization of publishing was taken further by GeoCities, a company who would give the ability to people to create web pages for communities for free.

As the telegraph became faster and more reliable, the materials needed to manufacture the cable changed. The new copper wires developed by American Samuel Morse in 1847 required a good insulation material (Tully, 2009, 563). \"By a neat coincidence,\" as Tully words it, a gum substance called \"gutta-percha\" was found in abundance in the forests of Southeast Asia, where the Dutch, British, and French had colonies, where the substance had been used to strengthen and perpetuate imperial rule (Tully, 2009, 563). The extraction of this gum proved highly ineficient and caused ecological disasters snce they had to extract many large trees just to get a few pounds of gum (Tully, 2009, 572). With the telegraph demand rising, the source became unsustainable and was threatened to be exhausted in as little as a few years in the last decade of the 19th century (Tully, 2009, 574). A sustainable method of extraction was recommended, but imperialist greed persisted (Tully, 2009, 577).

The authors begins with a critical consideration of the definition of a \"zoo\" and how the collection of networks, although not animals, can be called a zoo if gardened appropriately (Knight, S et Al., 2011, 1765). The article explicitly states that the argument is not to \"reflect the exact nature of the underlying network,\" but to \"show the network that the company intended\" (Knight, S et Al., 2011, 1765). As evidence and data was gathered from promotional data self published by the owner or manager of the network in question, it revealed something that normal measurements could not: \"What was in the mind of the network engineer when the network was designed, rather than what was built to meet the realities of day-to-day operation\" (Knight, S et Al., 2011, 1765). The three goals of the zoo is enumerated and explained: 1. to add to the scientific research of networks and accuracy of data; 2. to educate future network engineers; 3. to conserve historical networks examples like the ARPANET (Knight, S et Al., 2011, 1766). The article exhaustively offers a transparency description and exploration of the data and the implication of using the word \"topology.\" It then explores the classification of the network zoo such as one would do with a zoo filled with animals. The introduction of \"classification tags\" is stated as being \"easy to add new types without changing the existing classifications\" which is beneficial for the constant expansion of the fluid network zoo (Knight, S et Al., 2011, 1769). The overall network zoo points to an interesting case of network hierarchy. This hierarchy is fluid with the constantly increasing size of networks. The author emphasizes that the map of data shows that \"there are as many types of networks as there are network designers\" (Knight, S et Al., 2011, 1773).</p>"},{"location":"sourceNotes/%40knightInternetTopologyZoo2011/#how-does-it-relate-to-class","title":"How does it relate to class?","text":"<p>This article goes to show how incredibly complex and fluid the internet has become since early networks like the ARPANET.

We forget how things could have been different, since the influence of those of choices were that significant. We cannot talk about computers without talking about Cold War, but we cannot not also talk about the Cold War without talking about computers. To talk about computers is to talk about the Cold War, vice versa. Using this conundrum, MacDougall looks at the relationship between Video Games and Cold War, and how one cannot be talked about without the other. At roughly the 20 minute mark, MacDougall states how famous quotes like Howard Aiken's and Thomas Watson's could not see how the mass could require a computer that could do thousands of calculations per second, and this was because they did not understand how technology was going to develop and what the computer would become. Once the applications and softwares came along, people could see how they could have these machines in their houses. Real-time human machine feedback loop were being imagined in the 50s; this loop would later be exemplified with video games. MacDougall explores the idea of social science and how Cold War planners believed it was something you could scientifically build a model; building a game model! The results of those simulations were something becoming so real that it threatened officers, bending reality and resulting in real costs in blood and lives. So in that sense, after shaping the toys, the toys shaped back the human using them during Cold War which caused a cascade of problems. </p>"},{"location":"sourceNotes/%40macDougallKillerApp2014/#how-does-it-relate-to-class","title":"How does it relate to class?","text":"<p>MacDougall's talk offers a compelling argument about the power of the computer, but also about the Agency embedded in the creation of these tools, and how it shapes back the user.

However, there were political isues that wanted to make the telephone for the wealthier part of the market (MacDougall, 2013, 73). Forbes was one of the people who thought that the telephone should not belong to the people, but that it should be a \"tool of commerce, a modest refinement of the telegraph\" (MacDougall, 2013, 73). The telephone was therefore seen as a way to make money rather than populist reasons. Another vision was Theodore Vail, Bell Telphone's first general manager, who  wanted to think of the telephone industry as \"one big system\" (MacDougall, 2013, 78). He wanted to \"unify all wire communications in America - both telephone and telegraph - under one company's control\" (MacDougall, 2013, 85). This would envision the telephone as monopoly exercised by one company. MacDougall, throughout the article, paints this inescapable political attachment to the creation of the telephone and the competition of control it would create for North American companies (MacDougall, 2013, 90). </p>"},{"location":"sourceNotes/%40macDougallPeopleNetwork2013/#how-does-it-relate-to-class","title":"How does it relate to class?","text":"<p>This article illustrates the clear political entanglements of the telephone with its users and providers.

However, he point to the need to pay attention to \"whose globalization\" are affected, and \"what the globalization of politics, markets, and media means in its connection to communication\" (M\u00fcller, 2016, 509). The transatlantic cable was deemed a \"heroic struggle\" but other cable projects like to India had little attention (M\u00fcller, 2016, 511). The telegraph to other Non-Western countries were used for colonial communications, which means the non-elite individual could not use it, only colonial rulers (M\u00fcller, 2016, 513). The telegraph was therefore \"based on imperial structures - a global coloniality\" (M\u00fcller, 2016, 516).

Thus, in China, the internet is highly associated with tactics of political and information control. The author talks about the presence of censorship as an attempt to preserve control over the mass. This is done through manipulating the network and nodes and controlling what can be accessed, and what cannot. Censorship is also implemented by altering products coming from outside China like TV shows or YouTube videos. By isolating China's Internet's users, Beijing has \"prevented the Chinese people from enjoying its full benefits, especially the ability to freely communicate and cooperate with an increasingly global community of users\" (Mulvenon, 2008, 118).

The idea of laying down a wire in the atlantic was met with skepticism and worries about the safety of the cable (Standage, 1999, 74). This challenging task was first taken by Cyrus W. Field, who ironically was very ignorant about telegraphy but was also wealthy (Standage, 1999, 75). After a test run of laying cable between Newfoundland and New York was successful, the Atlantic Telegraph Company was set up for the transantlatic telegraph (Standage, 1999, 77). The first attempts of the company was doomed to fail when they hired Dr. Edward Whitehouse, who arogantly disregarded telegraph theory and based himself rather on experimentation results (Standage, 1999, 77). The cable he devised was too thin and had too high a voltage, so after a few attempts to laid the cables was finally achieved, the cable stopped working within a month as the high voltage degraded the cable (Standage, 1999, 84). Controversy arose around Whitehorse's telegraphy knowledge and involvement, and as such, Professor William Thomson, who closely studied submarine telegraphy theory, was hired and replaced Whitehorse for the next attempt (Standage, 1999, 86). In 1865, Europe and North America was successfuly connected which sparked the advent of a more connected world (Standage, 1999, 89). </p>"},{"location":"sourceNotes/%40standageVictorianInternet1999/#how-does-it-relate-to-class","title":"How does it relate to class?","text":"<p>The internet can be seen as a place that connects space across the world digitally.

The most powerful thing I learned in this course was how new ways of transmitting informations intensified notions Control and Agency, providing for a more powerful solution to control the mass while advertizing the internet as 'for' the people(People_and_the_network). I perceive the internet largely as a system of communications and information transferring, with the added benefits of creating communities (Digital_communities) and global connections. This was enabled by the Globalization_of_communication which extended control to all four corners of the world. However, with that expansion, it was easier to also extend political power and agendas, rendering the internet not as a source of free information, but as a source of controlled information. It goes without saying that information has always been controlled in different ways, like limiting accessibility behind reading abilities (common in the middle Ages), restricting information behind authoritative figures like the Church did in the past, or destroying culture and literature like happened during the Mongolian dynasties with various cultures. For this reason, with my path, I want to highlight how physical ways of controlled information (i.e. newspaper) evolved to the digital web and what that change implied on the consumer of that information.</p> <p>The first step in the journey is about Newspaper_culture. Newspaper, until roughly the 2000s, was the mainstream way of getting information and transmitting knowledge about and around the world. The agencies writing these newspapers would carefully and intentionally curate stories and information that would convey their Agency and political agendas. Already then, information control and propaganda agendas plague the system, but its physicality limits who sees it and how easy it is to spread. </p> <p>The next step looks at the Transmission_of_knowledge, to help us understand the selectiveness of knowledge, especially relevant with the case of newspaper. Sometime we take for granted how knowledge reaches us, therefore, it's important to understand how the information read on newspapers are a result of the efforts of coordination of agencies that made it possible. The coming of the internet will introduce new factors that will further dictates how information can be controlled. </p> <p>Agency is the next step, which is closely interconnected with the Transmission_of_knowledge as agency is what dictates what can and should be read. Who here decides what is important and what isn't? Who decides what is left behind, and what the public can see? These are all questions that considers the agency of information. </p> <p>We are then brought to my note about Imperialist_internet, which is inherently governed and directed by governments agencies. This note is interesting because it highlights the imperial tendencies that were present during the development of the internet all the way starting from the invention of the telegraph, which saw Imperial_needs that preyed on natural resources from non-western countries for materials like cables. This imperial character would remain dominant during for the creation of the internet.</p> <p>The following note about Control narrates the conflict of control that is present in the internet, further emphasizing on the notion seen earlier with the Transmission_of_knowledge. This one however talks about control in the specific context of the internet, and how there was a change from telegraph control to internet control. The telegraph was about political power (Politics_of_power) and connecting the world; the internet is still about political control, but now with a much more heavy emphasis on social control. </p> <p>This then leads us to my interest of research entry about Control_and_censorship. This further develops the previous note about control but reconsiders an added dimension of censorship. This notion would be explored in the next note.</p> <p>Censorship is an important aspect of my memex because it ties all the themes I have been focusing on: information, Agency, power, politics, and Control. The advent of the internet happened because there was a need to globalize the transmission of the internet, but now that information is so accessible and free, the government feels a need to implement policies to limit its impact. This often takes the form of censorship, with the intent of suppressing information that could threatened its society politically. The internet then becomes a library of information that was curated, selected, and approved for viewing. Anything that does not fit into the government's political agenda is subsequently oppressed and removed. </p> <p>Our journey then ends with my final note (People_and_the_network) about the main themes surrounding the internet (mostly revolving around my memex 3). This note wraps all the themes together and reconsiders the internet as 'for the people.' The internet came to be following a Globalization_of_communication, so it was really a network for the people, but it was quickly preyed over by capitalist companies that sought to further expand their territory of profit. This was especially seen with the enttishitification of the web with trends like Freemium models exploding and rendering the digital platform a 'pay-to-win.' At the end of the note, I provide a question that concerns me very much: \"How much of the internet will still be 'for the people' in 10-20 years?\"</p>"},{"location":"thoughts/The%20Final%20Journey/0_Final_Journey_1/#what-does-this-tell-me-about-the-internet","title":"What does this tell me about the internet?","text":"<p>This path tells me a lot about I saw the internet in this course. Some may have seen it as something more technological, or a different perspective, but I saw it more as a tool. A tool that can be used for many different uses. A tool that is neither good or bad. A tool that is inadvertably guided by the agency of the user. In my memex, I tended to focus on the negative use of the tool, that of Control,Agency, and Censorship. The devlopement that led to the internet could be considered a Globalization_of_communication, but in this context, I would like to argue that the internet can also be seen as the globalization of control and censorship. With people constantly connected and 'present' on the internet, it allows political and capitalist parties to exert power over a wider range with maximum efficacy. </p>"},{"location":"thoughts/The%20Final%20Journey/0_Final_Journey_1/#what-could-have-changed-and-conclusive-thoughts","title":"What could have changed and conclusive thoughts","text":"<p>Regarding this journey note, I think there a few things that I could have changed that would have made it easier and better. The first change involves the lack of gardening in my memex. While I thought I was gardening my notes appropriately, I was quickly made aware during my search for a journey path that my notes were only connected in 'batches.' So, I was getting paths that would only by 3-4 notes. I believe it would have been better if I appointed much more emphasis on gardening my notes and creating connections between notes. Another change that could prove beneficial is a more focus selection of sources. By this, I mean that choosing sources that are more evidently interrelated would have made the process of gardening much easier. Right now, the sources I have in my memex are separated by module (1, 2, and 3), so it is sometime hard to relate one part of the memex to the other. Even within those mini-memex, sources do not always follow a clear path or connection. Therefore, I think that a selection of sources with clearer connections would have made it easy for me to connect everything together. Overall, I am quite happy with the memex, but it is unfortunate that I only realized during my last memex (memex 3) that I should narrowed to a focused theme or issue about the internet. </p>"},{"location":"thoughts/The%20Final%20Journey/0_Final_Journey_2/","title":"Did I meet my goals for this course?","text":""},{"location":"thoughts/The%20Final%20Journey/0_Final_Journey_2/#the-journey-between-shivkumarclaytabletsweb2013-and-politics_of_communication","title":"The Journey Between @shivkumarClayTabletsWeb2013 and Politics_of_communication","text":"<ul> <li>@shivkumarClayTabletsWeb2013</li> <li>Organization_of_knowledge</li> <li>Globalization_of_communication</li> <li>Politics_of_communication</li> </ul>"},{"location":"thoughts/The%20Final%20Journey/0_Final_Journey_2/#what-were-my-goals","title":"What were my goals?","text":"<p>When I first opened the class and did the tutorial, I was prompted with the question of what I wanted to learn in this class.

While I said that I wanted to learn what the internet really was, what I was really asking was to see the internet in a different perspectives than I am already accustomed to. In that sense, this course succeeded in doing that. What I learned about the internet wasn't the intricacies of its digital system, but rather of its long and complex path that led to its creation. It seems that I had gone in the course with the idea that the internet was an isolated phenomenon, but I was quickly educated that the history of the internet actually dates a few centuries back, all the way to the classification schemes and early 'programers.' </p> <p>So exactly what did I learn about the internet? I learned that the internet is a phenomenon built on Competences that only arose because of social neccessities. These started long before the internet, when things were very much analog. Printing allowed people to reproduce knowledge which increased its accessibility. The telegraph then connected the world with trans-Atlantic cables to carry that information electronically. The phone was invented to further connect the world and convey information in real time across the world. Then, social neccessities created computers during the World Wars first as a mean of communication for military strategies, which then evolved its used in the scientific community and finally made its way commercially to the mass. These series of events and competences are what paved the road for the internet to even have the chance to be invented. Therefore, the history of the internet that I learned was not digital, but very much physical and analog. This is the perspective that I was lacking when I went into the course. I did not consider the role of these previous physical inventions and how the change in how information is organized and transmitted allowed for the internet to exist. </p> <p>The journey path that I chose for this note is quite short, largely due to a lack of proper gardening, but I believe it still powerfully conveys my point about the internet about being built on the need for classification and communication. </p> <p>The first note links Kumar's article (@shivkumarClayTabletsWeb2013) that talks about clay tablets and the early methods of classifications. This note is powerful as it sets a need for classification of knowledge that has been seen throughout history as early as 4000BCE and how the way people classified and organized knowledge changed with social neccessities and contexts. </p> <p>The next note is about the Organization_of_knowledge, and the presence of Agency that comes with it. It once again emphasizes the need to organize knowledge.</p> <p>The third note highlights the important impact of the Globalization_of_communication and how the world had now been connected by cables. </p> <p>The final note brings us to the Politics_of_communication, narrating its power in controlling information. With communications being globalized, it was now easier to control and monopolize these networks. The internet is therefore a political invention in a way; one that was born on the need to better classify and transfer information and improve communication. Although this journey does not specifically involve the digital internet itself, the internet can be understood when looked at what shaped it to be what it came to be. </p>"},{"location":"thoughts/The%20Final%20Journey/0_Final_Journey_2/#what-could-have-changed-and-conclusive-thoughts","title":"What could have changed and conclusive thoughts","text":"<p>While I did capture the big ideas, I failed to connect the smaller ones in my memex.

Perhaps if I had given a structure to my notes, like a chronological pattern, they could have flowed and connected better.

As such, technology first needs to catch up, and only then can there be an emergence. For example, in the context of the transatlantic telegraph, it was the existence of different technologies that allowed people to lay down a cable. Manufacturing the cable was not too difficult, but it was the presence of large steamboats that allowed these cables to be laid in the ocean in the first place.

This creates a class division between free users and paid users, that preys on free users to want all the features that they are so missing. Almost inciting FOMO (fear of missing out) in free users. This to me creates a dialogue of power and Control in the network disguised with Agency. The goal of these freemium plans are not to advantage the free users, but to disadvantage them enough to the point of forcing them to pay for the complete access. Some services on the web offer free services that are complete enough without paying for the paid version, but others intentionally implement \"free\" inconvenience.

The censorship situation in China is a great example as it shows how the government is using the power of communication to limit resistance and increase political propaganda. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"thoughts/atomicNotes/Politics_of_communication/#citational-information","title":"Citational Information","text":"<p>@headrickSubmarineTelegraphCables2001</p>"},{"location":"thoughts/atomicNotes/Politics_of_communication/#related-links","title":"Related Links","text":"<p>The politics of communications generated many technological power struggles: Politics_of_power</p>"},{"location":"thoughts/atomicNotes/Transmission_of_knowledge/","title":"Transmission of knowledge","text":"<p>tags:: Memex1, Atomic, Accessibility, Media, Catalogue, Control</p> <ul> <li>For those born in the last 2 decades, the immediate access of the internet's vast resources has been something as natural as walking.

This selectiveness of knowledge is still present today despite digital libraries being available to all with electricity and an internet connection. What did not change from the past is the presence of agency of what kind of knowledge is transmitted.

MacDougall in his presentation about video games and cold war seems to think it is a real-time human machine feedback loop. I partly agree with this definition. The human user is definitely interacting with the video games which is hosted on a machine, but it is important to consider the Agency and intention of that machine. \"We shape toys and toys shapes us\" (MacDougall, YouTube).

In these games, a large number of people gathers under a common interest in an interactive way.

Visibility of speech is something you could caracterized both as a physical and metaphorical notion. In one way, it could be the accessibility of speech to those with hearing difficulties so that they can \"see\" speech. For example, somekind of way to transform speech to text. In the past, this was not quite achievable, but today, technology exists which makes it possible to instantly convert speech to text that can be read by a deaf person. This physically and literally makes speech visibible. On the other side, it could also be the expansion of communication that makes speech \"visible\" to a larger network. It allows people to communicate over a larger area, faster and conveniently. The telephone is an example of visibility of speech as it made people \"visible\" on a larger network of voices. </li> <li>The presence of \"visibility of speech\" also indicates that there must be a similar opposing notion of \"invisibility of speech.\" Perhaps this refers to the Control and censorship of these larger communcation networks, that discriminates against certain groups to silence their voices. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"thoughts/atomicNotes/Visibility_of_speech/#citational-information","title":"Citational Information","text":"<p>@macDougallPeopleNetwork2013</p>"},{"location":"thoughts/atomicNotes/Visibility_of_speech/#related-links","title":"Related Links","text":"<p>Who's voice can be made visible?

For this section, I would like to rely on ideas that my peers have collected in their memexes.</li> <li>Sophie, in her memex offered a detailed thought about AI and what it can do. She is scared at the problem of ethics with the use of AI, such as with the deepfakes of unknowing people for pornography purposes. She also talks about her worries with AI written essays and its implication of education. With AI becoming increasingly more accessible, anyone will be able to use these tools with a few clicks. I am then thinking: What are we then learning when we are letting AIs do all our works and homeworks? How can we even prevent that without going in the extremist path of censorship and information control?</li> <li>Eric, in his memex, makes a really intriguing observation about the accessibility of AI in the context of Alexa. Here they states: \"Alexa was designed so that anyone could intuitively use it without a shred of understanding how it works. That is the trend for a lot of new technologies these days, trying to take away as much control as possible from the user.\" Taking control from the user. This phrase worries me because this means that the price of accessibility with these tools results in us no longer having power over them. By not understanding these \"accessible\" tools, the user only see what it can do, but not what it can really do (like Alexa eavesdropping constantly or applications taking control of camera on phone).</li> <li>AI are machine, do machine have human rights or any rights? If its the AI performing the deed, does it fall on the initiator or the fabricator? The ethics of AI are still heavily debated and researched today and will continue to do so as AI practices continues to shift. Laura Martin's \"Article intellingence and human rights\" tries to reconsider AI and human rights. These academic researches are important as we are in a desire need to establish ethical boundaries for AI before its too late.

By better understanding the Politics_of_power that shaped the development of the telegraph and the Globalization_of_communication, I gained a new perspective on what exactly the internet is.

The indestructable system developed in the Cold War only helped faciliate this expansion by distributing nodes of networks across the world. Although the early internet had a strong emphasis as being free and for the free speech of people, it quickly caught the eye of capital investers and businesses would start monetizing the platform. We saw this with the Freemium models that quite literally puts free users at a disadvantage by limiting them of full access of knowledge and information behind a paywall.
