- While building the first part of my memex, I came to realize that I have been increasingly curious and intrigued by the nature of the classification of information and its [[agency]]. This first memex seems to focus on the idea [[organization_of_knowledge]], deciding what makes the cut and what is left out or [[Who_is_left_out]]. 
- This idea will be developed further in the second part of my memex with [[Politics_of_power]] and [[Politics_of_communication]].
