- What is the visibility of speech? Visibility of speech is something you could caracterized both as a physical and metaphorical notion. In one way, it could be the accessibility of speech to those with hearing difficulties so that they can "see" speech. For example, somekind of way to transform speech to text. In the past, this was not quite achievable, but today, technology exists which makes it possible to instantly convert speech to text that can be read by a deaf person. This physically and literally makes speech visibible. On the other side, it could also be the expansion of communication that makes speech "visible" to a larger network. It allows people to communicate over a larger area, faster and conveniently. The telephone is an example of visibility of speech as it made people "visible" on a larger network of voices. 
- The presence of "visibility of speech" also indicates that there must be a similar opposing notion of "invisibility of speech." Perhaps this refers to the [[Control]] and censorship of these larger communcation networks, that discriminates against certain groups to silence their voices.
