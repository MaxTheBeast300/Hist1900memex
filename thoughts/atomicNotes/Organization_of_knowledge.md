-   Who decides where the information goes? Who has the authority to decide how information should be organized and classified? Why should one system of classification be better than another? These are things that I try to ask myself as I see diverse ways of organizing knowledge while browsing the web. They are often in alphabetic order and appear to contain all the different disciplines of knowledge, but are they really objective? When the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme was created, they organized knowledge **based on their Anglo-Saxon perspectives**. As such, the wild-spread classification system that came out was not objective, but deeply rooted in the agency of its creator.
