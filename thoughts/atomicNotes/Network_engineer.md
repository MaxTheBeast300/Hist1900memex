-   The internet is not a phenomenon that has just "appeared," it was specifically engineered and expanded that way. One of the people who enabled the global connection of computers are *network engineers.* According to [Emeritus](https://emeritus.org/blog/technology-network-engineer-do/#:~:text=Network%20engineers%20are%20responsible%20for,performance%2C%20and%20troubleshooting%20network%20issues.), network engineers "are responsible for designing, maintaining, implementing, and troubleshooting an organization's computer networks." They are the ones laying down the infrastructure of the internet with every expansion. Everything that is engineered *must* be intentional, therefore, the way a (new or existing) network is created is defined by its network engineer. These networks can contain [[Agency]] and intents of [[Control]] for companies trying to maintain monopolies like phone companies in Canada. Just how power does a network engineer have in deciding how a new network should be implemented?
