- As made evident throughout the course, the internet is a highly politicized invention as global communication goes hand in hand with politics of power. Why is that so? Why does communication need to be politicized when it should be about cultural and social connections? By controlling and monopolizing global communications, political entities can politically influence the masses. Communication is how we discover and learn, so what happens when someone controls what "speech" is made visible? Especially relevant in today's political scene, the politics of communication is a tool used to control and subdue the public by censorship and curation of information available to the connected networks. The censorship situation in China is a great example as it shows how the government is using the power of communication to limit resistance and increase political propaganda.
