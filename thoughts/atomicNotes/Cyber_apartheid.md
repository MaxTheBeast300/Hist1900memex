- An interesting keyword used in James Mulvenon's [Golden shields and Panopticons](http://www.jstor.org/stable/43133785) is the creation of a "cyber apartheid." This is done by preventing the Chinese people from freely communicating with the global communities. In doing so, the "Chinese Communist Party has protected its monopoly on power at the expense of individual freedom" (Mulvenon, 2008, 118). These systems seek to control the political influence of the internet by limiting external interferences with domestic communications and systems of informations. Another example of this can be seen with the heavy censorship of North Korea. Like China, they heavily limit what data is being received and sent, curating a network designed for that particular domestic space.
